### What I learned

The most challenging part of this project was to make the animated toggle button but with the help of[Yaya12085](https://uiverse.io/profile/Yaya12085) I was able to make it.

### Continued development

I plan to fix and rework any mistakes and imperfections that might be found and marked by the community.
